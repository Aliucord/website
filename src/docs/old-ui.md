**Reasons of why Aliucord uses an old Discord version**

- The new Discord app is React Native while the Discord version that Aliucord uses (126.21) is Kotlin. React Native is a framework for building apps using JavaScript, which is not as performant as Kotlin code. Discord's React Native version is known to have performance issues, especially on lower-end devices, because the app has been ported from iOS over to Android.

- Everything would need to be rewritten, wasting time, considering how bad the new Discord version is.

- Aliucord developers don't like to work with the new one. [Notice from the AliucordRN repository](https://github.com/Aliucord/AliucordRN#-notice-)

- If Aliucord ceases to exist, there wouldn't be any active clients using the good old Discord version.

<p>warning:
Bluecord is also a modded client for the old version of Discord, but the main developer has done bad things in the past, so use it at your own risk.<br>

- Features from new Discord versions can be backported to the old one. [What does backporting mean?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backporting)

- Modded clients for the new Discord version already exist, such as [Kettu](https://github.com/C0C0B01/KettuManager/releases/download/1220/Manager.apk).
